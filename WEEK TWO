First of all,it is i who have to complain what a short week.How i wish a week like this week could lasts forever, as there are so many days off.

1) Learning hours; 
Like last week, I usually learn to hours every weekday and about four hours on weekend.

2) Learning progress; 
A slow learner，as i said last week. 

3) Your implementation of the tasks you have done this week; 
As for c，I learned arrays, pointers, and structures，and did some small interesting tests.I will show you soon with my files.
As for Linux, i learned how to create and the move and remove files and directories. And how to find and grep.
Also another very important thing is that i download Mobaxterm, which was found very useful.
And as a for 5G,I read a few inferences about it.It's not a little interesting.

4) Unsolved problems(if any); 
The first thing that i want to say is that i can't find the apropriate data type for string.
Despite the fact that i think i've solved this problem by using char arraies, but i think i still need to have a better solution.
May i have your suggestions?

5) Plan for the next week.
Given that i've learned most knowledges about c,(As far as i am concerned,) I make a decision to learn computer network next week.
And it's necessary that i should read more about 5G. 
Basic commonts about Linux should be learned.
