weekly reports--week one

1) Learning hours
About 2-3 hours per day on weekday.About 4-5 hours per day on weekend.

2) Learning progress
I'm a very slow learner. But for this week i have learned how to use primitive data types, operators and expressions, how to control flow functions, program structures, input and output.
And also i think i've already learned how to use git to update my learning progress.
Besides，i think i learned a little about how to use Linux.For example, i've learned how to change dictionary and how to vim to a certain degree.
Maybe there are just small progress but they will be an inspiration that will inspire me to keep on moving.Slow though my learning progress, i won't quit.

3) Your implementation of the tasks you have done this week
I will show you in the other files.

4) Unsolved problems(if any)
In fact, i can't remember very well，but most of the times i've already solved all my problems.
For example, i mistake by wrongly using global variables and local variables.

5) Plan for the next week.
First i want to accomplish my C learning.
Second, i think i will learn ssh.
Thirdly, i will read some books if time permits.
last but not least,I am going to learn Computer Network
